# Operating-Systems

This repository includes programs from my CPSC 3220: Operating Systems class at Clemson University.


The Threaded_MergeSort project reads in numbers from a text file and outputs the sorted results in an output file.

The Scheduler project simulates a scheduler in an operating system using First In First Out, Shortest Job First, and Round Robin.
